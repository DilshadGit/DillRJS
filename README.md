# DillRJS
## Install and create first reactJS
first you have to install following
reactjs and nodejs
# sudo apt install nodejs

node -v # check the version

'''
If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. 
In most cases, youâ€™ll also want to also install npm, the Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing 
the npm package with apt:
'''
sudo apt install npm

npm -v
9.2.0

# create reactjs
npm create react-app tutorials

# start run
cd tutorials
npm start

# npm is start running npm package runner
npm run this line below
npm create react-app project_name

## To installed globally first we need to run
npm install create-react-app -g
## next
create react-app project-name

## Component Types are two:
1. Stateless Functional Component (JS function)
function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello react Js</h1>;
}

2. Stateful Class Component
Class extending Component class
Render method returning HTML

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}

#### Functional Components:
Property(props) ---> JavaScript Function ----> HTML(JSX)
 Going to ---> src/App.js

#### Class Components
Are basically the same ES6 class 

Properties(props) -----> ES6 -----> HTML (JSX)

## Functional vs Class components

# function Simple functions,
 - Use Func components as much as possible
 - Absence of 'this' keyword
 - Solution without using state
 - Mainly responsible for the UI
 - Stateless / Dumb / Presentational

# Class Components
 - More feature rich
 - Maintain their own private data - state
 - Complex UI logic
 - Provide lifecycle hooks
 - Stateful / Smart / Container

## react alpha Introducting https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

HOOKS:
- No breaking changes
- Completely opt-in & 100% backwards-compatible.
- What ever we've learned so far in this series still holds good.
- Component types - Functional components and Class components
- Using state, lifecycle methods and 'this' binding.
- After understanding state, event binding and lifecycle hooks in class components.
